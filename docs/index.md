## Features Overview

### Hints

Code hints are an essential aid to mastering external libraries. They also offer a convenience in your own code, and provide incentives to better document code with JSDoc comment strings.

### Github

Export your changes right to your Github repo. If you need to make live edits to Github, you can do so right in the editor. The editor provides basic Github integration including code diffs, highlighted files with changes, pulling and committing.

Be sure to give it a try. Also please checkout our Github [repos](https://github.com/spckio) on more info on [embedding ](https://github.com/spckio/spck-embed) Spck Editor in your own site as well as libraries that Spck Editor is built upon.

### Diffs

File diffing is an awesome feature that any great code editor with git integration needs. More features will be added to the code differ in the near future, for example, char-by-char diffs as well as in-place diff editting.

### Import & Export Zip

An alternative to Github commits is exporting your project as a zip file. You can transfer your project to another device by the reverse operation of importing. Note that the exported file may have Unix-style newlines (meaning a single "\n" character instead of "\r\n", however, any proper code editor should handle this automatically in Windows.

### Search

Project-wide code searching is a useful tool for any JavaScript development. Navigating between files by keywords and refactoring are all made easier with an awesome fast search feature. There's still room to improve with the editor's search, so we need your [feedback](https://github.com/spckio/spck-issues) on any ideas to improve the editor!

### Live Preview

Live previewing is a feature so essential, its barely worth mentioning. However... Spck Editor supports two modes of previewing, in a separate browser tab as well as an inline iframe for quicker edits-to-preview.

Additionally, previewing also work great in Spck Editor's mobile app. So if your interested in giving JavaScript development a try on your mobile device, be sure to download our [mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.spck&hl=en_CA&pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1).
