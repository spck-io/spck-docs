## GIT

* __Credentials__: Opens up the GIT Credential modal to change credentials used for different GIT providers (i.e. Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Other)

This is an example of using a Github app token to connect to your Github repositories. Cloning or pulling public repositories will not require an app token.

<img width="300" src="./img/editor-settings/git-credentials-1.png">

If an invalid app token is set, you will receive "Invalid credentials" error message or "Authentication Error" regardless if the repository is public or private. Make sure you grant the token proper access writes, and allow additional settings to push to the Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket branch. (For example, the master branch may be locked and prevent pushing which will also result in an error.) To properly create an access token, please see [Creating an Access Token for Spck Editor.](./create-app-token.html)
